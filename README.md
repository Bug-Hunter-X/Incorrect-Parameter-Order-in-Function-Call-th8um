# Incorrect Parameter Order in Swift Function Call

This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in Swift: passing function arguments in the wrong order when using named parameters.  While Swift allows this, it can lead to unexpected results and difficult-to-debug issues.

The `bug.swift` file shows the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.swift` provides a corrected version emphasizing the importance of maintaining the intended parameter order.
